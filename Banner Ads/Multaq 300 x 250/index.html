MULTAQ doubles the risk of death in these patients.</p><p>MULTAQ is contraindicated in patients in atrial fibrillation (AFib) who will not or cannot be cardioverted into normal sinus rhythm. In patients with permanent AFib, MULTAQ doubles the risk of death, stroke, and hospitalization for heart failure.</p></div><p><span class="subhead">MULTAQ is also contraindicated in patients:</span><ul><li>With second- or third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block or sick sinus syndrome (except when used in conjunction with a functioning pacemaker), bradycardia &lt;50 bpm, QTc Bazett interval &ge;500 ms or PR interval &gt;280 ms</li><li>Who are or may become pregnant (Category X) or nursing. MULTAQ may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman</li><li>With concomitant use of strong CYP 3A inhibitors, such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, cyclosporine, telithromycin, clarithromycin, nefazodone, ritonavir, or drugs or herbal products that prolong the QT interval and might increase the risk of Torsade de Pointes, such as phenothiazine antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, certain oral macrolide antibiotics, and Class I and III antiarrhythmics</li><li>With liver or lung toxicity related to the previous use of amiodarone</li><li>With severe hepatic impairment</li><li>With hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients</li></ul></p><p><span class="subhead">Cardiovascular Death in NYHA Class IV or Decompensated Heart Failure</span> MULTAQ is contraindicated in patients with NYHA Class IV heart failure or symptomatic heart failure with recent decompensation requiring hospitalization because it doubles the risk of death.</p><p><span class="subhead">Cardiovascular Death and Heart Failure in Permanent AFib</span> MULTAQ doubles the risk of cardiovascular death (largely arrhythmic) and heart failure events in patients with permanent AFib. Patients treated with MULTAQ should undergo monitoring of cardiac rhythm no less often than every 3 months. Cardiovert patients who are in AFib (if clinically indicated) or discontinue MULTAQ. MULTAQ offers no benefit in subjects in permanent AFib.</p><p><span class="subhead">Increased Risk of Stroke in Permanent AFib</span> In a placebo-controlled study in patients with permanent AFib, dronedarone was associated with an increased risk of stroke, particularly in the first two weeks of therapy. MULTAQ should only be initiated in patients in sinus rhythm who are receiving appropriate antithrombotic therapy.</p><p><span class="subhead">New Onset or Worsening Heart Failure</span> New onset or worsening of heart failure has been reported during treatment with MULTAQ in the postmarketing setting. In a placebo-controlled study in patients with permanent AFib, increased rates of heart failure were observed in patients with normal left ventricular function and no history of symptomatic heart failure, as well as those with a history of heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction.</p><p>Advise patients to consult a physician if they develop signs or symptoms of heart failure, such as weight gain, dependent edema, or increasing shortness of breath. If heart failure develops or worsens and requires hospitalization, discontinue MULTAQ.</p><p><span class="subhead">Liver Injury</span> Hepatocellular liver injury, including acute liver failure requiring transplant, has been reported in patients treated with MULTAQ in the postmarketing setting. Advise patients treated with MULTAQ to report immediately symptoms suggesting hepatic injury (such as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, fever, malaise, fatigue, right upper quadrant pain, jaundice, dark urine, or itching). Consider obtaining periodic hepatic serum enzymes, especially during the first 6 months of treatment. It is not known whether routine periodic monitoring of serum enzymes will prevent the development of severe liver injury. If hepatic injury is suspected, promptly discontinue MULTAQ and test serum enzymes, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase, as well as serum bilirubin, to establish whether there is liver injury. If liver injury is found, institute appropriate treatment and investigate the probable cause. Do not restart MULTAQ in patients without another explanation for the observed liver injury.</p><p><span class="subhead">Pulmonary Toxicity</span> Cases of interstitial lung disease including pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis have been reported in patients treated with MULTAQ in the post-marketing setting. Onset of dyspnea or non-productive cough may be related to pulmonary toxicity and patients should be carefully evaluated clinically. If pulmonary toxicity is confirmed, MULTAQ should be discontinued.</p><p><span class="subhead">Hypokalemia and Hypomagnesemia with Potassium-Depleting Diuretics</span> Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia may occur with concomitant administration of potassium-depleting diuretics. Potassium levels should be within the normal range prior to administration of MULTAQ and maintained in the normal range during administration of MULTAQ.</p><p><span class="subhead">QT Interval Prolongation</span> MULTAQ induces a moderate (average of about 10 ms but much greater effects have been observed) QTc (Bazett) prolongation. If the QTc Bazett interval is &ge;500 ms, discontinue MULTAQ.</p><p><span class="subhead">Renal Impairment and Failure</span> Marked increase in serum creatinine, pre-renal azotemia and acute renal failure, often in the setting of heart failure or hypovolemia, have been reported in patients taking MULTAQ. In most cases, these effects appear to be reversible upon drug discontinuation and with appropriate medical treatment. Monitor renal function periodically.</p><p>Small increases in creatinine levels (about 0.1 mg/dL) following MULTAQ treatment initiation have been shown to be a result of inhibition of creatinineâ€™s tubular secretion. The elevation has a rapid onset, reaches a plateau after 7 days and is reversible after discontinuation.</p><p><span class="subhead">Women of Childbearing Potential</span> Premenopausal women who have not undergone a hysterectomy or oophorectomy must use effective contraception while using MULTAQ. Dronedarone caused fetal harm in animal studies at doses equivalent to recommended human doses. Counsel women of childbearing potential regarding appropriate contraceptive choices.</p><p><span class="subhead">Drug-Drug Interactions</span><ul><li>Treatment with Class I or III antiarrhythmics or drugs that are strong inhibitors of CYP 3A must be stopped before starting MULTAQ (see Contraindications)</li><li>Patients should be instructed to avoid grapefruit juice beverages while taking MULTAQ</li><li>Calcium channel blockers with depressant effects and beta-blockers could increase the bradycardia effects of MULTAQ on conduction</li><li>In the ANDROMEDA (patients with recently decompensated heart failure) and PALLAS (patients with permanent AFib) trials, baseline use of digoxin was associated with an increased risk of arrhythmic or sudden death in MULTAQ-treated patients compared to placebo. In patients not taking digoxin, no difference in risk of sudden death was observed in the MULTAQ vs placebo groups<p class="isi-special">Digoxin can potentiate the electrophysiologic effects of MULTAQ (such as decreased AV-node conduction). MULTAQ increases exposure to digoxin</p><p class="isi-special">Consider discontinuing digoxin. If digoxin treatment is continued, halve the dose of digoxin, monitor serum levels closely, and observe for toxicity</p></li><li>Postmarketing cases of increased INR with or without bleeding events have been reported in warfarin-treated patients initiated with MULTAQ. Monitor INR after initiating MULTAQ in patients taking warfarin</li><li>Statins: Avoid simvastatin doses greater than 10 mg daily. Follow statin label recommendations for use with CYP 3A and P-gP inhibitors such as MULTAQ</li></ul></p><p><span class="subhead">Adverse Reactions</span> In studies, the most common adverse reactions observed with MULTAQ were diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, and asthenia.</p><p>Click <span class="isi-link">here</span> for full Prescribing Information, including boxed WARNING.</p><br><img class="isi-logo" src="_Assets/img/sanofi-logo.png"><p>&copy; sanofi-aventis U.S. LLC</p><p>A SANOFI COMPANY</p><p>MAT-US-2008748 | 06/20</p></div></div></div><!-- <script>var clickTag1 = 'https://www.multaq.com/hcp/savings-and-support/savings';
