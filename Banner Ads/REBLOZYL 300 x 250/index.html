						<p><span class="color2"><strong>INDICATION</strong> </span></p>	
						<p><strong>REBLOZYL is indicated for the treatment of anemia failing an erythropoiesis stimulating agent and requiring 2 or more red blood cell units over 8&nbsp;weeks in adult patients with very low- to intermediate-risk myelodysplastic syndromes with ring sideroblasts (MDS-RS) or with myelodysplastic/ myeloproliferative neoplasm with ring sideroblasts and thrombocytosis (MDS/MPN-RS-T).</strong></p>
						<p><strong>REBLOZYL is not indicated for use as a substitute for RBC transfusions in patients who require immediate correction of anemia.</strong></p>
						<p><strong class="color2">IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</strong></p>
						<p><strong class="color1">WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS</strong><br/>
						<strong>Thrombosis/Thromboembolism</strong><br/>
						In adult patients with beta thalassemia, thromboembolic events (TEE) were reported in 8/223 (3.6%) of REBLOZYL-treated patients. TEEs included deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, portal vein thrombosis, and ischemic stroke. Patients with known risk factors for thromboembolism (splenectomy or concomitant use of hormone replacement therapy) may be at further increased risk of thromboembolic conditions. Consider thromboprophylaxis in patients at increased risk of TEE. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of thromboembolic events and institute treatment promptly.</p>
						<p><strong>Hypertension</strong><br/>
						Hypertension was reported in 10.7% (61/571) of REBLOZYL-treated patients. Across clinical studies, the incidence of Grade 3 to 4 hypertension ranged from 1.8% to 8.6%. In adult patients with MDS with normal baseline blood pressure, 26 (29.9%) patients developed SBP &ge;130 mm Hg and 23 (16.4%) patients developed DBP &ge;80 mm Hg. Monitor blood pressure prior to each administration. Manage new or exacerbations of preexisting hypertension using <br>anti-hypertensive agents.</p>
						<p><strong>Embryo-Fetal Toxicity</strong><br/>
						REBLOZYL may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. REBLOZYL caused increased <br>post-implantation loss, decreased litter size, and an increased incidence of skeletal variations in pregnant rat and rabbit studies. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 3 months after the final dose.</p>
						<p><span class="color1"><strong>ADVERSE REACTIONS</strong></span><br/>
						Grade &gt;3 (&ge;2%) adverse reactions included fatigue, hypertension, syncope and musculoskeletal pain. A fatal adverse reaction occurred in 5 (2.1%) patients. The most common (&ge;10%) adverse reactions included fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, dizziness, diarrhea, nausea, hypersensitivity reactions, hypertension, headache, upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, and urinary tract infection.</p>
						<p><span class="color1"><strong>LACTATION</strong></span><br/>
						It is not known whether REBLOZYL is excreted into human milk or absorbed systemically after ingestion by a nursing infant. REBLOZYL was detected in milk of lactating rats. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, and because of the unknown effects of REBLOZYL in infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue treatment. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed child, breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment and for <br>3 months after the last dose.</p>
